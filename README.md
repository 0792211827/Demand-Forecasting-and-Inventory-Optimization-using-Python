# Overview
## **Tittle** Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization
**Overview**: Demand Forecasting means estimating future customer demand for a product or service based on historical data and relevant factors.Inventory Optimization is the strategic management of inventory levels to ensure that the right amount of goods is available at the right time to meet customer demand while minimizing costs.We  used an  appropriate forecasting model, SARIMA,for demand forecasting.Then, we used the demand forecasts to optimize inventory levels by implementing strategies like reorder points, safety stock, and economic order quantity (EOQ) calculations.

**Aim**: Develop a model that  aims to strike a balance between having sufficient stock to meet demand without carrying excess inventory that ties up capital and storage space. Effective inventory optimization helps businesses reduce carrying costs, improve cash flow, and enhance customer satisfaction.
# Importance of the prediction
* **Cost Reduction:** By predicting demand more accurately, companies can reduce excess inventory and the associated holding costs, such as storage, insurance, and obsolescence. Simultaneously, minimizing stockouts reduces the need for costly expedited shipping and emergency orders. The overall reduction in inventory-related costs leads to increased profitability.
* **Improved Customer Satisfaction:** Accurate demand forecasting helps ensure that the right products are available at the right time. This leads to better service levels and higher customer satisfaction, as customers are more likely to find what they need without experiencing stockouts.Inventory optimization complements this by maintaining optimal stock levels, avoiding both overstocking and understocking.
* **Enhanced Operational Efficiency:** Accurate forecasts enable better planning for production schedules, labor, and resource allocation. Optimized inventory levels ensure smooth operations, reducing delays and inefficiencies caused by stockouts or overstock scenarios. This operational efficiency not only enhances productivity but also enables the business to respond more swiftly to market changes and opportunities, maintaining a competitive edge.
# Technologies Used
* **Python:** Leveraging Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building time series models.
* **Time series models:** Implementing the SARIMA model  to forecast the demand.
* **Data Analysis:** Utilizing tools like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
